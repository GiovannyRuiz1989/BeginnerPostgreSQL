# BeginnerPostgreSQL

This is a project developed for an undergraduate student to apply the basic concepts of database management. 
First, create a database for a company called Northwind using PostgreSQL software; 
second, create the data using a webpage mockaroo; 
and third, create queries to extract relevant data from the database. 
The schema to create the database can be found as an image called "Northwind_db_schema", 
the code to create the database and upload the data in "pg_northwind_db", 
and a series of example queries in "northwind query" with images that show the output on the console.
